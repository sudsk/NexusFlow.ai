# NexusFlow.ai

![NexusFlow.ai](docs/assets/logo.png)

NexusFlow.ai has great potential to be extended into a more comprehensive agentic AI flow tool. Let me outline a folder and file structure that leverages your existing code while supporting the new architecture.

**Reusable Components**

**Frontend**

Most of your existing UI code is very usable and aligns well with the architecture diagram:

Flow Designer: Your existing FlowBuilder.jsx, FlowEditor.jsx, and related components can form the core of this module
Agent Config Component: AgentConfigEditor.jsx and NodePropertiesPanel.jsx provide a solid foundation
Flow Testing Console: FlowTestConsole.jsx can be used as-is with minor modifications
Settings: Your existing settings page can be extended

**Backend**

On the backend side, these components can be retained and extended:

Core Agent System: Your agent, capability, and flow implementations provide a solid core
API Routes: The existing FastAPI routes provide good RESTful patterns
Database Models: Your existing models are well-designed for the PostgreSQL database

**Implementation Strategy**  
**1. Framework Adapter Layer**  
This is the key addition needed to support multiple frameworks:  

Create an adapter_interface.py that defines common methods for all frameworks:

convert_flow(nexusflow_flow) -> framework_flow
execute_flow(framework_flow, input_data) -> execution_result
register_tools(tools) -> framework_tools


Implement adapters for each framework (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, etc.)

**2. Core Services Layer**
Enhance your existing code with dedicated services:

Flow Management Service: Build on your existing Flow class
Execution Service: Extend your execution functionality
Authentication Service: Add proper authentication for multi-user support

**3. Frontend Enhancements**
Your existing frontend code is quite capable, but needs these additions:

Framework selection dropdown in Flow Designer
Framework-specific configuration options
Enhanced visualization for different framework execution patterns

**4. Storage Service**
Implement proper storage service for:

Flow definitions
Execution histories
Agent configurations
Tool configurations

**What Can Stay Almost As-Is**

Agent Implementation: Your agent system is well-designed
Capability Registry: The capability system can be retained
API Structure: Your FastAPI implementation is solid
UI Components: Most React components can be reused
Database Models: Your existing models work well

**What Needs Significant Changes**

Flow Execution Engine: Needs to delegate to framework adapters
Tool Registry: Needs to map to framework-specific tool formats
Authentication: Needs to be implemented for multi-user support
Deployment: Needs to handle framework-specific deployment requirements

This structure maintains backward compatibility with your existing codebase while laying the foundation for the multi-framework support and enhanced features you're looking to implement. The adapter pattern will be crucial for integrating with various frameworks without changing your core business logic.

**Updated Architecture**
Your original architecture diagram is solid and works well as a conceptual foundation. Here's how I'd refine it slightly:
![Architecture](docs/assets/architecture-diagram.svg)

The key change in this refined architecture is the addition of an API Gateway layer between the Frontend and Core Services, which will handle authentication, request validation, and routing.

**Files to Delete**

Since you're open to significant changes, here's a categorization of your existing files:
Files to Keep (with modifications)

Most frontend UI components (with updated API integrations)
Database models and session management
Core agent data structures

**Files to Delete or Completely Rewrite**

nexusflow/core/flow.py - Replace with adapter-based implementation
nexusflow/core/node.py - Replace with framework-specific implementations
nexusflow/graph/ directory - Replace with adapter-based implementations
nexusflow/api/routes.py - Rewrite to work with new service layer
nexusflow/api/server.py - Replace with a more configurable API gateway
nexusflow/llm/ directory - Replace with a more modular provider system

**Files to Add**

New adapter interfaces and implementations
Service-layer implementations
Framework-specific converters
Tool registry with framework mappings
